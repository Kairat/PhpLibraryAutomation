This is a research project that studies the possibility of building a library process automation system using the PHP language.

The main goal of this project is to develop approaches to creating an information system that will be able to optimize the work of libraries by automating routine operations, such as accounting for books, issuing them to readers, managing catalogs, etc.

The project is a kind of "warm-up for the mind", namely, an attempt to imagine what an automated information and library system could be. It does not aim at practical application, for example, creating real information and library systems. This is a completely academic development, intended for demonstration to students of the Irkutsk National Research Technical University studying automated information systems.
